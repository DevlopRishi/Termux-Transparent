# Termux Transparent

This guide walks you through the steps to adjust the background opacity in Termux, allowing for a transparent or semi-transparent terminal view on your Android device. Adjusting the opacity can improve visibility or aesthetics, especially if you're using custom wallpapers.

## Prerequisites

- **Termux** app installed on your Android device.  
  *[Download from F-Droid if needed, as it's no longer updated on the Google Play Store]*

## Steps

### 1. Locate the Termux Properties File
First, navigate to the **`.termux`** directory to edit the configuration file.

1. Open Termux.
2. Run the following command to create the `.termux` directory if it doesn’t exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.termux
   ```
3. Open the Termux properties file with a text editor. If it doesn’t exist, create it:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.termux/termux.properties
   ```

### 2. Add Opacity Settings
To set the desired background opacity:

1. In the `termux.properties` file, add the following line:
   ```bash
   background_opacity = <value>
   ```
   Replace `<value>` with a number between **0** and **1**:
   - **0** = Fully transparent
   - **1** = Fully opaque (no transparency)
   
   Example for 50% opacity:
   ```bash
   background_opacity = 0.5
   ```

2. Save and close the file (in nano, press `CTRL + O`, then `Enter` to save, and `CTRL + X` to exit).

### 3. Apply the Changes
After editing `termux.properties`, restart Termux to apply the new settings:

```bash
termux-reload-settings
```

Now, your Termux background should reflect the chosen opacity level.

## Example

```bash
background_opacity = 0.8
```

This will give the Termux terminal an 80% opaque background, allowing some wallpaper visibility but with a solid appearance.

## Notes

- Experiment with different values to find what works best with your wallpaper.
- Increasing transparency may affect readability based on your background.
